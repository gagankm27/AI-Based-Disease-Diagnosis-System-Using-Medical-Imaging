## üî¨ AI-Based Disease Diagnosis System Using Medical Imaging

### üìå Overview

AI-powered medical imaging leverages advanced image processing and machine learning techniques to detect, classify, and evaluate diseases. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals by improving diagnostic accuracy, reducing workload, and enabling early disease detection.

### üéØ Key Applications of AI in Medical Imaging

1. **Cardiovascular Abnormality Detection**
   AI accelerates cardiac image analysis‚Äîan otherwise repetitive and time-consuming task‚Äîallowing cardiologists to focus on critical cases. (Source: *Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine, 2019*)

2. **Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Prediction**
   AI models can detect early metabolic changes in the brain, enabling prediction of Alzheimer‚Äôs years before clinical symptoms appear. (Source: *Radiologic Society of America*)

3. **Cancer Detection**
   In 2020, Google Health developed an AI model that outperformed radiologists in detecting breast cancer from mammograms, demonstrating AI's potential in early cancer detection.

4. **Treatment Evaluation**
   AI systems track tumor size changes in cancer patients undergoing therapy, helping to assess treatment effectiveness over time.

5. **Surgical Planning**
   AI algorithms segment surgical regions in medical images, enabling automatic planning that can reduce surgery time and improve precision.

### üìä Maturity of AI in Medical Imaging

* Many AI applications have shown exceptional performance in research and pilot studies (e.g., breast and pancreatic cancer detection).
* Real-world adoption remains limited due to challenges such as long FDA approval cycles and inconsistent clinical impact.
* Notably, a cancer detection system approved by the FDA in 1998 cost over \$400M but showed no significant improvement in outcomes.

‚úÖ Despite hurdles, the future is promising. In 2020, researchers at the Technical University of Munich developed a model that detects diabetes-induced eye diseases with human-level accuracy.
